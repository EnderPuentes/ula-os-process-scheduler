# ðŸ‘¾ Process Scheduler Simulator

This simulator emulates the execution of processes on a CPU, applying a scheduling algorithm and managing process states. Its purpose is to analyze the behavior of different scheduling strategies in a controlled environment.

## Definition

This simulator manages processes with different states:

- **READY**: The process is ready to be executed.
- **RUNNING**: The process is currently executing on the CPU.
- **BLOCKED**: The process is waiting for an event (e.g., I/O operation) to be resolved.
- **COMPLETED**: The process has finished execution.

### Process Queues

- **Ready Queue**: Contains processes in the READY state, waiting to be executed.
- **Blocked Queue**: Contains processes in the BLOCKED state, waiting for an event to be resolved.

## About this

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project, created with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It includes a process scheduling simulator implementing the following algorithms:

### Preemptive Algorithms

- **Priority Scheduling:** Assigns a priority to each process, and the CPU always attends to the process with the highest priority. If a higher-priority process arrives, the current process is interrupted.
- **Round Robin:** Each process receives a fixed amount of time (quantum) to execute. If the process does not finish within this time, it is moved to the end of the queue, and another process takes over.
- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF):** A variation of SJF where the process with the shortest remaining execution time is always selected next, even if it interrupts the currently running process.

### Non-Preemptive Algorithms

- **First Come, First Served (FCFS):** Processes execute in the order they arrive, without interruptions.
- **Priority Scheduling:** Similar to the preemptive version, but once a process starts execution, it cannot be interrupted.
- **Random Scheduling:** Randomly selects a process from the ready queue for execution.
- **Shortest Job First (SJF):** Executes the process with the shortest estimated execution time first, without preempting ongoing processes.

## Configuration

The simulator allows adjusting the following parameters:

### General Parameters

- **Clock speed**: Defines the time for each tick of the simulator's clock.
- **Initial number of processes**: Determines how many processes are generated at the start of the simulation.
- **Maximum CPU burst duration**: Sets the upper limit for a process's execution time on the CPU.
- **Maximum blocked wait time**: Controls how long a process can stay in the blocked queue before retrying execution.
- **Maximum number of concurrent processes**: Defines how many processes can exist in the system simultaneously.

### Scheduling Algorithm Configuration

- **Quantum**: (For Round Robin) Defines the number of ticks before a process must yield the CPU.
- **Priority type**: (For priority scheduling) Can be static or dynamic.
- **SJF mode**: Allows selecting whether the algorithm is preemptive or non-preemptive.

### Process Configuration

- **Random process generation**: Enables or disables the automatic creation of new processes during the simulation.
- **Burst time range**: Defines the minimum and maximum values for process duration.
- **Blocking probability**: Determines how often a process enters the BLOCKED state.
- **Maximum wait time in the ready queue**: Adjusts how long a process can wait before being prioritized for execution.

## User Interface

The simulator features an interactive UI displaying process execution details in real-time. The main UI elements include:

- **Control Panel:** Allows pausing and resuming execution, selecting scheduling algorithms, and adjusting configurations.
- **Processing Status:** Displays the current CPU state and the number of blocked and ready processes.
- **Performance Metrics:** Shows CPU usage, total ticks, total processes, and average execution statistics.
- **Process Control Table:** Lists all active processes with details like priority, state, burst time, remaining time, waiting time, and turnaround time.

## Statistics

During the simulation, the following metrics are collected:

- **Average waiting time**
- **CPU utilization**
- **Total execution time**
- **Total number of executed processes**
- **Average blocked time**
- **Number of context switches**

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two parts:

1. **Graphical Interface (Frontend):** Built with Next.js for visualizing the scheduling algorithms. The UI runs on the client and is composed of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and components from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
2. **Simulation Logic (Backend):** Manages processes and executes the scheduling algorithms.

All simulator-related logic is located in `./src/libs`. The project uses TypeScript, with type definitions stored in `./src/lib/types.ts`.

The simulator is based on a **Base Simulator** class, with each algorithm having a child class that inherits the base functionality. Each child class only implements the process scheduler and a method to sort the ready queue. Additionally, the **Simulator** class uses a `notify` function to inform the UI of changes, ensuring real-time synchronization.

### Handling Blocked Processes

To simulate I/O operations, when generating random processes, if the **burst time** is greater than 5, a **burst I/O** time is assigned. When the process reaches half of its execution, it is blocked to "simulate disk writing." Once unblocked, it is reinserted into the ready queue and resumes execution according to the active scheduling algorithm on the next context switch.

Blocked processes are stored in a **Blocked Queue**, which manages their transitions back into the ready queue after I/O completion.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:EnderPuentes/ula-so-process-scheduler.git process-scheduler
cd process-scheduler
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

You can start editing the application by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you make changes.
